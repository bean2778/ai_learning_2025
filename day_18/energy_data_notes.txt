tab 1
    181915 rows
    previousYearToDate is missing 17105 rows (probably all the first year entries)
    the columns value and share are numeric
tab 2
    the value distribution in horrible skewed to the left (I think we need logarthmic correction)
    there is a long tail to the right after the initial spike in value but it's pretty continuous. I don't know if that counts as outliers
    years covered are 2010 to 2022
tab 3 
    the products with the highest value are aggregate values (electricity supplied, Fossil fuels, Final consumptions).
        the discreet vales that do the best are Hydro, Coal, Natural Gas, nuclear
    there are no clear trends for value to year. Correlation is -0.24
    Hydro and fossil fuels seem to be a pretty clear winner across all countries 
tab 4 
    mostly gives warnings about missing vals in previous year (about 10%, I think they're from the first year)
        and zeros in share, which I think is fine b/c maybe that courtry doesn't use that thing

Step 2 Questions
    1) 2010 to 2022
    2) 52 distinct countries
    3) low carbon, fossil fuels, Other renweables, nuclear, other combustable,
        not specified, total imports, and several others
    4) wind is highest in Nov and Dec, honestly, it's hard to get that information out of the chart
        b/c it's month and year combined so it's not easy to look at all Januaries together
    5) it's a box graph for year to product but other renweables has it's box the farthest up so maybe 
        that one. I don't think the tools are set up to know that very well. I think a scatter plot 
        of product to year may have been good
    6) I think the share column is everything

Step 3
    I think I like which countries show the best conditions for battery investment

Next Steps Questions
    1) The surprising thing about the data is how much I'm going to have to change my tooling to 
        make it useful I think. I may be misreading it though
    2) really none. 
    3) Countries that are good for battery investment b/c I can check share of renewables in 
        a country compared to the total
